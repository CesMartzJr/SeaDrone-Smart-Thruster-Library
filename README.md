# SeaDrone Smart Thruster Library

This Python library allows to control up to 15 brushless motors from a single serial port and provide real time feedback for the velocity, current, voltage and temperature of each driver.

Designed specifically to work with the SeaDroneTM Smart Thruster Breakout Board: <https://seadronepro.com/shop-seadrone/>

**These motor drivers use the serial port to communicate, so a total of 2 pins (TX and RX) are required as interface. The open source breakout board is also compatible with most USB-to-serial 3.3V adapters, to be plugged into any USB port.**
